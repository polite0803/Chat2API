/**
 * Wiring assertions for the request path.
 *
 * Every other compression test drives a pure function, so none of them can see
 * whether the function is actually CALLED, or in what order. Those two facts are
 * the load-bearing part of this feature:
 *
 * - the duplication measurement must run BEFORE compression, because it answers
 *   "how much does the client's own request repeat itself" — measuring after a
 *   rewrite would report our edits instead of the client's behaviour;
 * - compression must run BEFORE the managed tool layer, because that layer
 *   appends protocol markup which must never pass through a content compressor;
 * - the verbosity block must run AFTER compression and BEFORE the tool layer,
 *   because it edits the same system message the tool layer appends to, and a
 *   style hint must never outrank the tool contract.
 *
 * This is a source-structure test, the same technique `tests/api/parameter-policy`
 * already uses for ordering rules that a unit test cannot observe.
