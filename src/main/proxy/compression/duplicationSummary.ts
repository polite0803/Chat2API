/**
 * Aggregation for the cross-turn duplication measurements recorded on request
 * logs.
 *
 * Pure so it can be tested without a store or an HTTP context, and so the
 * endpoint stays a thin projection.
 *
 * The honest shape of this report matters more than the numbers in it: the
 * request log keeps only the newest `maxEntries` rows, so this is a WINDOW, not
 * a lifetime total. Every response therefore carries `sampled` and
 * `logRetention`, and ratios are computed over the sample only. Reporting a
 * window as a lifetime figure would make a five-request sample look like
 * evidence about the deployment.
