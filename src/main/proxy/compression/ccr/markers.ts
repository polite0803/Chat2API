 * CCR (Compress-Cache-Retrieve) markers.
 *
 * A lossy compression is only defensible if the original is still reachable.
 * Every rewrite we perform therefore leaves a marker carrying a content hash,
 * and the original bytes are stashed under that hash.
 *
 * Two shapes exist and they are NOT interchangeable (headroom `crusher.rs:606`
 * vs `:1161`):
 *
 *   - object arrays drop ROWS and append a sentinel OBJECT,
 *   - scalar arrays drop ITEMS and append a sentinel STRING.
 *
 * The sentinel is a deliberate schema break: an "array of uniform records" is
 * no longer uniform. Consumers must filter it, which is what
 * `isCcrSentinel` / `stripCcrSentinels` are for. Re-compressing a payload that
 * already carries a sentinel is never correct — the second pass would treat the
 * compressed text as source and hash the marker itself.
