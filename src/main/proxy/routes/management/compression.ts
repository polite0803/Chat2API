 * The measurement itself never rewrites a request (see `compression/duplication`),
 * so this endpoint is the only consumer of it.
 *
 * Three honesty constraints, each visible in the payload rather than buried:
 *
 * - it reports the **request-log window**, not a lifetime total; the log keeps
 *   only `maxEntries` rows, so `sampled` is small on a fresh install and the
 *   ratios are over that sample alone;
 * - `unmeasured` is reported separately from a zero — "not looked at" is not
 *   "looked and found nothing";
 * - `ratio` is `null` when nothing was scanned, never `0`.
 *
 * `duplicatedChars` is raw message-text characters, NOT tokens. Converting it
 * would need the model's tokenizer, which this app does not carry.
